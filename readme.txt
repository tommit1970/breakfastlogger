  IMPORTANT!!!!!

One new obstacle is the Personal Access Token(PAT) in the github-system.
I made one PAT that lasts for one week(7 days). It will have to be renewed after a week.

See LastPass - GitHub - notes! I need to use this for a while to get used to it.

Currently in Progress:

Thoughts and ideas for change:
------------------------------
- red 'Removed' on Delete Recording
- Red color on: 'Out of range' and 'not a number'
- Admin cheat menu (with toggles) / Regular user menu (no toggles)
- Logfile for changes - metalogfile
- monthly structure, 'january', 'february', etc. on 'Show Recordings'
- ask for date on 'Show One Recording'
- Clean Module-structure
